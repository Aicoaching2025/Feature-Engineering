## Overview

Welcome to the **Feature Engineering & Data Visualization Project**! This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into insightful features that unlock hidden patterns and boost predictive power. We’re using the classic Titanic dataset to illustrate every step—from initial exploration to advanced feature engineering—making data science both fun and impactful.

## Introduction

In this project, you will learn to:
- **Explore and clean data** with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Visualize data distributions and relationships** using colorful plots and heatmaps.
- **Engineer new features** (like creating a `FamilySize` feature) that better capture the underlying data patterns.
- **Compare pre- and post-engineering results** with side-by-side visualizations to see the impact of your transformations.
- **(Optional)** Enhance your machine learning model performance through improved features!

## Features & Visualizations

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Tackle missing values, outliers, and transform data types for smooth analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots that reveal the story behind your data.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Transform your data by combining existing features, encoding categorical variables, and applying mathematical transformations.

- **Dynamic Visual Comparisons:**  
  Use side-by-side charts and correlation heatmaps to visualize the power of engineered features compared to the original ones.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/feature-engineering-project.git
   cd feature-engineering-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Feature_Engineering.ipynb
   ```

## How to Run

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**  
  Begin by importing and cleaning your data. The code in the notebook demonstrates how to load the Titanic dataset and handle missing values.

- **EDA & Visualization:**  
  Visualize feature distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Follow the notebook sections to create new features like `FamilySize` and encode categorical data.

- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  Compare your results with side-by-side visualizations and updated correlation heatmaps to see how your engineered features impact model readiness.
